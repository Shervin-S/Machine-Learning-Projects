Sentiment Analysis - 
   This tool performs sentiment analysis using the `TextBlob` and `nltk` libraries. The user inputs text, and the `TextBlob` library calculates the sentiment polarity, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. `nltk` is used to handle text tokenization, while `TextBlob` simplifies sentiment analysis.
