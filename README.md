1) Sentiment Analysis
This tool performs sentiment analysis using the `TextBlob` and `nltk` libraries. The user inputs text, and the `TextBlob` library calculates the sentiment polarity, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. `nltk` is used to handle text tokenization, while `TextBlob` simplifies sentiment analysis.

2) Handwritten Digits Recognition
The first code (train_digit_recognizer.py) trains a CNN model on the MNIST dataset and saves the trained model as mnist.h5. The second code (gui_digit_recognizer.py) loads the saved model (mnist.h5) and provides a GUI created using Tkinter libary where users can draw digits, which the model then predicts.
